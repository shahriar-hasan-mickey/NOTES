Whenever I try to install some .deb packages which I downloaded before (e.g. Atom, BP-tools etc.) I receive this error in Ubuntu 17.10:

./bp-tools_17.12_amd64_Xenial_free.deb 
./bp-tools_17.12_amd64_Xenial_free.deb: line 1: syntax error near
unexpected token `newline' ./bp-tools_17.12_amd64_Xenial_free.deb:
line 1: `!<arch>'

can anyone help, please? 




Try installing the software with

dpkg --install <Package_Name>

Like in your case just cd into the directory and then type the above command like

dpkg --install libpng12-0_1.2.50-2+deb8u3_amd64.deb

// the above doesn't work for parrot os

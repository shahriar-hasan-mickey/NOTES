I'm having exactly the same problem, beforeit was working normally when I type:
ctrl+b + % = vertical split
ctrl+b + " = horizontal split

Now I'm getting:
ctrl+b + % = Can't find window 5 (it tries to switch window by number)
ctrl+b + " = index prompt (it asks for the window index)

I don't know why the behaviour of these two shortcuts had change, I did nothing.
How do I turn back to the correct behaviour?

@edit
Ops! I found the problem, the correct shortcut is:
(ctrl+b) + (shift + %) and (ctrl+b) + (shift + ")
What is strange is that before I didn't remember of pressing shift to enable these functions...
Anyway, disregard my problem.
